<P>

Guildford is situated on the A3 London to Portsmouth trunk road and is 10 miles south of junction 10 of the M25.</P>
<P>
Travelling south on the A3, take the second turn-off after the M25,signposted to Guildford and Burpham, A3100 (the first turning is signposted to Ockham and Ripley).
<BR>Continue on this road, negotiating several mini roundabouts. At the fifth one (which is big and grassy) take the second exit, which leads into London Road. Our clubhouse is about 200 metres along on the right hand side.</P>
<P>
Travelling north on A3 pass under the Hog's Back road (A31), pass the exit to The Cathedral and University and take the next exit, signposted Guildford Town Centre.<BR>
At the end of the slip road there is a roundabout, take the second exit. Go straight on at the pedestrian lights, ignore town centre sign and continue straight over the next lights, (Ladymead Retail Park will be on your left hand side).<BR>
Continue straight over the next lights (Stoke Crossroads), pass the Parkway pub and Travel Lodge on left-hand side, Stoke Park will then appear on your right hand side, on your left will be Spectrum.<BR>
At the roundabout turn right (3rd exit) into London Road. Our clubhouse is about 200 metres along on the right hand side.</P>
<P>
Approaching from the east or west follow signs to Leisure Centre or Spectrum, it's the same place and eventually you will be guided to the Stoke Crossroads traffic lights, continue to follow the instructions to Spectrum. 
If you get hopelessly lost ask for directions to the Spectrum.. ( its just over the road from the park).</P>

<P>
Whilst we do have our own car park (next to the clubhouse) it can quickly get full. Additional car-parking is available along the length of London Road (note that local buses do run at weekends so don`t park at the bus-stops) or at the Spectrum sports centre. PLEASE PARK CONSIDERATELY and especially do not park in local private roads, such as St Margarets.</P>
<P>
Please avoid using the car-park next to Challengers ( they need it on a Sunday!), and do not park on the grass verges around the park (Guildford Borough Council will issue parking tickets if you are caught).
