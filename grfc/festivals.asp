</ul>

<P>Typically we have 1,500 players attending from ages U7s to U12s, from across Surrey and the wider region.</P>
<P>We are very proud of the positive feedback our festival receives. Whatever the weather (and we have had the full range from wet and cold to warm and sunny), and win or lose, it is our aim to ensure that all the players have a good day of rugby and go home happy.</P>
<P>From 2012, all of our festivals will be both an A and a B level festival. Clubs may enter either the A festival, the B festival or both. Please submit a separate entry form for A and B. It is our intention that the level of teams taking part should correspond to their Surrey play level.</P>
<P>If you have any questions or comments, please contact our festival organiser (see <A HREF="contacts.cshtml" TARGET="new">contacts page</A> for details).</P>
<P>Entry is by way of our festival entry form only accompanied by payment. Entries are dealt with on a first-come, first-served basis and are subject to the discretion of Guildfordians RFC. Entry forms can be downloaded from here (please ensure you have the correct form):</P>

    <p>When you are communicating with the Festival Organiser, can you please indicate the CLUB & AGE GROUP on whose behalf you are writing. This will avoid any confusion, and unnecessary delay in responding to your enquiry.</p>

<P><A CLASS="heading" NAME="info">Further information for those attending one of our festivals</A></P>

<P><B>Timings</B></P>

<P>Registration is at 9:30 at the applicable age control desk. The festival starts at 10:00.</P>

<p>With a large number of competitors and teams, please make every effort to have teams ready at the scheduled times to allow the smooth running of the event.</p>
<P>Please make sure that you arrive in good time, remembering that parking can be quite distant (see below). Any team not ready in time to play may forfeit a match to their opponent.</P>

<P><B>Player Registration</B></P>

Please complete one Player Registration form for each team entered and hand it to the age group control at the Festival.
<P><B>Referees & Referees' Meetings</B></P>

<P>Referees' meetings will take place at 9:45 at the applicable age control desk.</P>
<P>Each team must bring one referee. Any team who fails to provide a referee may be excluded from the festival.</P>
<P>We would ask that all referees are ready at the relevant time to referee a match - delays in the programme most often occur because the allocated referee cannot be found. Many thanks.</P>
<p>Once we understand who is progressing from the group stage to the finals, we may require an independent referee to officiate these late matches. We have been held up previously in trying to locate such an independent referee. Can nominated referees please be prepared to be asked to assist with this.</p>
<P>Further notes for referees <A HREF="festivals.asp#info_refs">are below</A>, please would all referees familiarise themselves with these before the tournament.</P>

<P><B>Pitches</B></P>

<P>click <A HREF="popup_festmap.html?1" TARGET="new">here</A> for a map of Stoke Park, showing the location of the various pitches and facilities.</P>

<P><B>Shelters</B></P>
 
<P>Stoke Park can get quite windy and therefore cold particularly if wet. We cannot provide shelters for visitors. All visiting teams must ensure that they have adequate shelter for players and that the players are suitably clothed.</P>

<P><B>Directions</B></P>

<P>click <A HREF="location.asp" TARGET="new">here</A> for general directions to our grounds.</P>
 
<P><B>Car Parking</B></P>

<P>Car parking will be available at:
<UL>
<LI>Baker Tilley</LI>
<LI>North Car Park unless it has been raining</LI>
</UL>
(All are marked on <A HREF="/documents/Car Parking 2013.pdf" TARGET="new">this map</A>.)</P>

<P>Please do not park on the grass verges, paths, yellow lines or private roads around Stoke Park, and allow plenty of time (at least 20 mins) to park and get to the correct part of Stoke Park.</P>
<P>At previous festivals we have had some drivers who have disregarded this request, which has prompted complaints from the Council and a threat to not allow us to run further festivals. Parking therefore will be monitored closely and we reserve the right to exclude from the festival any team that does not respect this request. Additionally, Traffic Wardens will be patrolling the area.</P>
 
<B>Codes of Conduct</B>

<P>All players, coaches and parents are asked to abide by the applicable codes of conduct available <A HREF="cpp.asp" TARGET="new">here</A>.</P>
<P>We reserve the right to exclude from any game or the festival any player, coach, spectator or team whose conduct is not in accordance with the Codes of Conduct.</P>

<P><B>Any Problems?</B></P>
<P>If you experience any problems or have any complaints please raise them immediately with a Guildfordians coach and/or the Guildfordians Festival Organiser, so that we can attempt to address the issue immediately.</P>

<P><A  CLASS="static-link" HREF="festivals.asp#top">back to top</A></P>

<P><A CLASS="heading" NAME="info_refs">Notes for referees</A></P>
<p>Surrey is now moving to the New Rules of Play for under 10 and below. See <a href="http://www.rfu.com/thegame/regulations">http://www.rfu.com/thegame/regulations</a></p>
<P><B>Important: Safety</B></P>

<P>We are keen that this tournament runs as a safe event and ask that referees and coaches are particularly diligent in enforcing the following rules from the Continuum.
<UL>
<LI>A player must not hand-off or fend off an opponent in any way. It is important to note that a hand-off/fend off is defined as "ANY movement of the hand, arm or ball to ward off a would-be tackler."</LI>
<LI>High tackles should be deemed as dangerous play and a penalty awarded.</LI>
<LI>Barging a player into touch will not be considered a fair tackle.</LI>
<LI>Repeated offences should be penalised</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P><B>Important: Fair Play</B></P>

<P>At Guildfordians we put high values on fair-play and good sportsmanship. Accordingly, any behaviour not in accordance with our <A HREF="cpp.asp" TARGET="new">codes of conduct</A> including any abusive conduct towards referees will not be tolerated. We ask that referees work together with Guildfordians' coaches to achieve a good rugby playing environment.</P>
<P>In particular:-
<UL>
<LI>as referees you have authority over the pitch and its environs - if there is inappropriate behaviour by a spectator please take such action as you deem appropriate and/or raise the matter with a Guildfordians coach or official as soon as possible</LI>
<LI>please raise any complaints or concerns with a Guildfordians coach or official as soon as possible;  and</LI>
<LI>if you experience any abuse from any player, coach or spectator you have the authority and the support of Guildfordians to exclude such player, coach, spectator or the entire team from the match.</LI>
</UL>
