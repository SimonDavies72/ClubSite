        <h1>Welcome to the Social!</h1>
    <p>I was made aware recently that I needed to update these pages that are aimed specifically at Social Members of Guildfordians RFC. Fortunately, most of the sentiments expressed about what we are hoping to achieve need little updating. I would just say though that in the last year or so we’ve had had five very enjoyable lunches when lots of old friendships have been renewed, old memories revived, and club funds increased by people taking out memberships. We’ve also proved our worth in supporting the current teams from the touchline but as yet none of has received the call to bring our kit along with us just in case!</p>

<p>For anybody who’s reading these pages for the first time, I’ve kept a few paragraphs that explain how we’ve come to be back enjoying the social side of rugby at Stoke Park:-</p>

<div style="margin: 0 30px;font-style:italic"><p>….At the recent Guildfordians’ RFC lunch at Stoke Park (Dec 2012), I returned from a brief absence from the main assembly to find that I had been 'elected' to cover for Colin Walker in the matter of publicising any similar future events. Now, just a few weeks later, Social Members at Guildfordians RFC have got their own page on the club web site.
</p>
        <p>There are, I'm sure, a large number of people out there who remember an age of great social camaraderie at Stoke Park interspersed with the occasional burst of athleticism and skill on the rugby pitch. It is the aim of the current players to continue that tradition, though perhaps with even more attention being paid to the rugby skills (difficult to believe, I know!). I for one am really pleased that the spirit that we enjoyed so much lives on, and hope that you and I can do our little bit to ensure that it does.
</p>
        <p>Just as, when we were in our playing days - and I realise that for many of us that is many months ago now - the club is largely run by the players for the players. We probably remember how grateful we were to have a few older people around to help out with various things and to support us as players. Well, time has now moved on and it would be great to think that we could now put back something into the setting we all enjoyed. The good news is that we could also have a lot of fun doing so, and see a bit more of old friends in the process.

<p><strong>Please make sure that you set this up now in your Contacts (rather than risking it going into your Junk email).</strong></p>

<p>You can email comments, suggestions, memories to this address, and we’ll use it to send out the occasional email, particularly to let you know if we’ve updated the website, or to give a reminder that a key date is approaching.</p>
        
<h2>Social Membership</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether or not you are able to attend any of the social events, please consider contributing in some way to the continuation of rugby at Stoke Park. It goes without saying that a bit of cash always helps to make the club environment as attractive as possible, keeps equipment up to scratch etc.</p>

<p><strong>Annual social membership</strong> is £20 per annum, but, if paid after January 1st, £30 will provide membership to the end of the following season which, I'm sure you'll agree, is a great deal. However, what's even better is that the club  is offering 
    <strong>Lifetime social membership</strong> for just £120! </p>

<p>Taking out membership will help the club enormously, and your involvement and support will help ensure the continuation of Guildfordians Rugby in the heart of Guildford. In about 3 seasons' time, the club, as part of the OGAC, is preparing to renew the lease of the Clubhouse. The council are currently in support and so the club is raising funds in preparation.</p>

<p>The benefits of social membership are as follows:-</p>
    <ul>
<li>Invitations to Club functions</li>
<li>Invitations to supporters' lunches</li>
<li>Options to buy international tickets (subject to availability)</li>
<li>	Options to buy tickets for other events at reduced prices, e.g. an annual junior tournament at the Stoop followed by a Harlequins match, The Big Match at Twickenham in December, and tickets to the Premiership Final (subject to availability)</li>
</ul>
    <p>In addition, if your interest extends beyond just the social side, you can receive regular club updates with all the latest news of how our junior and senior teams are developing, latest results etc.</p>
<p><strong>If you wish to take up social membership, please complete and return, either by post or email, the <a href="/documents/membership_form.pdf">Club Membership form</a>. (Don't worry about the signature for now if emailing).</strong></p>

<p>Please also let us know if the email address we're using for you is the one you prefer to use for this sort of correspondence. And, while we're on the subject of addresses, why not contact a few of your old mates from those days and pass on this information on to them?</p>

<p><strong>NB You don't of course have to have played rugby for the OGs in the past to take up social membership. We hope that non-rugby players will also find it an informal way to keep in touch with friends.</strong></p>
<p>Hoping to see you at Stoke Park in the near future.</p>

<p>Nick Edwards (OGRFC Club Captain '76 - '79)</p>
