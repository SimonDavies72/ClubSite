        <p><a class="heading" name="when">When and where do we meet?</a></p>

        <p>
            For our Micros, Minis, Youth and Girls, rugby takes place on Sundays throughout
            the season (September - early May). We usually meet at the clubhouse in Stoke Park
            (click <a href="location.asp">here</a> for directions).
        </p>
        <p>
            For coaching sessions and home fixtures we start at 10.00. Coaching usually finishes
            around noon (fixtures sometimes go on later). The clubhouse is open for refreshments
            between 10.00 and 13.00.
        </p>
        <p>
            For away games we will issue special instructions - please try to help with transport
            if you can. Most other clubs in general start at 10.00.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also hold festivals which can last most of the day. Be prepared - bring picnics
            and make it a family day out!
        </p>
        <p>
            If in doubt please check with the relevant age group manager to check timings, please
            see the&nbsp;<a href="contacts.cshtml#age">contacts page</a> for their details.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you would like to know more contact our club secretary (see <a href="contacts.cshtml">
                contacts page</a> for details).
        </p>

        <p><a class="static-link" href="about.asp#top">back to top</a></p>

        <p><a class="heading" name="play">Can I join?</a></p>

        <p>
            Boys and girls from age 5 to 17 are welcome to join us, and are grouped according
            to age:  Under 6, up to Under 17. They play in mixed teams up to Under 12's and
            thereafter the teams are single-sex. A child's group is decided by age on the first
            of September, in whole years, plus one. We believe that every member of the Club
            should play in one of the teams, when they have had sufficient training. We believe
            that creating a strong sense of team and club spirit is very important.
        </p>
        <p>Children who are aged 3 or 4 can join our micros section, it's extremely good fun
            with about 30 boys and girls turning up. Children who will be 3 during the year
            are more than welcome to join in but only by prior arrangement with the coaching
            staff.</p>
        <p>Being parents ourselves, we understand that children need to try different activities
            before committing, so we have a "try before you buy" membership scheme. All newcomers
            can come along and join in for 3 weeks. After this, if they wish to continue we
            ask that you pay the appropriate membership fee or they can stop playing without
            charge.</p>

        <p>
            The membership form can be downloaded by selecting <b>Club | Documents >> | Membership
                form</b> above; please complete this and bring it with you on your first visit.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you would like to know more, phone or email our membership secretary (see <a href="contacts.cshtml">
                contacts page</a> for details).

        <p><a class="heading" name="danger">Isn't rugby dangerous?</a></p>

        <p>
            We strongly believe that rugby is a safe, enjoyable and worthwhile activity for
            children. Children do not tackle each other until they are at least 8 years old
            and even then there is a slow methodical introduction. Our child protection policy
            can be viewed by clicking <a href="cpp.asp">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p><a class="heading" name="needed">What's needed to play?</a></p>

        <p>
            The season runs from September through the winter, to late April. At the start of
            the season, jerseys, shorts etc. should be fine. In the colder weather children
            are still proud to wear their Guildfordians jerseys, so make sure they have sufficient
            clothing underneath. With younger children we recommend that they wear woolly hats
            and some form of waterproof jacket and trousers (these are easy to clean!)
        </p>
        <p>The Kit Sales Manager maintains a well-stocked 'shop' with the Club kit of red socks,
            dark green shorts and jerseys, for sale at reasonable prices. There is also a selection
            of second-hand kit, including boots.</p>
        <p>As it becomes wetter and muddier, boots will be essential. Soccer boots are OK, but
            make sure the studs are aluminium, and the approved kite-marked type. Insist on
            the correct studs from your retailer!</p>
        <p>
            The Club recommends that players in all age groups should wear a gum shield, it
            is a club policy that all players involved with full contact rugby (U9's and above)
            must have a gum shield to play. Gum shields tailor-made by your dentist are ideal.
            However sports shops and the Club shop sell DIY versions that you soften by heating
            in boiling water and then mould around the teeth. A gum shield must be correctly
            fitted otherwise it can be dangerous, when the player opens their mouth their gum
            shield must remain on their teeth and not drop down - if it drops down it can be
            easily remoulded.
        </p>

        <p>
            The kit shop is located in changing room 8 and is open on Sundays 9:45 to 10:30
            and 11:45 to 12:30.
